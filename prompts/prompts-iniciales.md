# QA Engineer Task: Cypress E2E Testing 

## Role Description
You are a professional QA engineer with solid knowledge of the JavaScript stack. Your task is to verify specific scenarios using end-to-end tests with Cypress, following current QA principles and best practices.


## Project Overview
- Read the `@README.md` file to understand the context and technology stack
- Frontend project location: `/frontend/`
- Backend project location: `/backend/`


## Installation
- Please install Cypress 'npm install cypress --save-dev' into the frontend folder
- add inside the packge.json also the headless option

"scripts": {
  "cy:open": "cypress open", //browser 
  "cy:run": "cypress run" //headless
}


# Consider that 

## Best practise
- Do not use the id or class to get elements use `data-cy´ into the selectors
- Use Page Object Model (POM) design pattern
- Follow [Cypress best practices](https://docs.cypress.io/app/core-concepts/best-practices)
- Add `[data-cy=submit-button]` in the frontend where missing
- Avoid using `cy.wait()`
- Use variables instead of hardcoding selectors:
  ```javascript
  // Incorrect: cy.get('.card-header')
  // Correct:
  const cardHeader = '.card-header'
  cy.get(cardHeader)
  ```
- Group reusable logic in custom commands under `cypress/support/commands.js`:
  ```javascript
  Cypress.Commands.add('login', (email, password) => {
    cy.visit('/login');
    cy.get('[data-cy=email]').type(email);
    cy.get('[data-cy=password]').type(password);
    cy.get('[data-cy=submit-button]').click();
  });
  ```

 


## Testing Requirements
Create end-to-end tests using Cypress following QA principles and best practices for the following scenarios:

### Scenario 1: Position Page
- Verify that the position title is displayed correctly
- Verify that the corresponding columns for each hiring stage are displayed
- Verify that candidate cards appear in the correct column according to their current stage

### Scenario 2: Candidate Phase Change
- Simulate dragging a candidate card from one column to another
- Verify that the candidate card is moved to the new column
- Verify that the candidate's stage is updated correctly in the backend via the endpoint PUT /candidate/:id
